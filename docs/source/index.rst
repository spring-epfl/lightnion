=====================================
Welcome to Lightnion's documentation!
=====================================

Introduction
============

Lightnion is a JavaScript library that you can include on your webpage to let
any modern browser make anonymous requests. Lightnion uses an *untrusted*
proxy to interact with the Tor network. This proxy converts between protocols
(Websockets to pure TCP).

**WARNING:** At the moment Lightnion is alpha-level research software. Do *not*
use it in production, or for anything that really requires anonymity. You are,
however, more than welcome to experiment with Lightnion. Please provide
feedback opening issues or writing to the authors.
